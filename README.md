## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Prajeeta, a software engineer and aspiring quant analyst in Mumbai.

I am currently learning financial modeling and building quant projects. Previously, I have worked at @BluestockFintech @BPCL and @Wipro.

I'm passionate about building high-impact, large-scale products that blend intuitive design with powerful technology. I've contributed to high-traffic platforms and dashboards, led feature development, and streamlined systems in customer-facing applications. My work spans both frontend and backend roles, with experience in industry-relevant projects and research.

Outside of work, I'm deeply curious about science and emerging technologies. I also create digital designs and write tech-related blogs.
