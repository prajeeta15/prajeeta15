## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
I'm Prajeeta, a software engineer and analyst in Mumbai.

I currently work as a software engineer at @BluestockFintech. Previously, I was at @BPCL and @Wipro.

I'm passionate about building high-impact, large-scale products that blend intuitive design with powerful technology. I've contributed to high-traffic platforms and dashboards, led feature development, and streamlined systems in customer-facing applications. My work spans both frontend and backend roles, with experience in industry-relevant projects and research.

Outside of work, I'm deeply curious about science and emerging technologies. I also create digital designs and write tech-related blogs. 

Currently, I'm expanding my skills by learning Python with a focus on cybersecurity.
